* About

This work is a part of the [[file:../readme.org][ParkinsonPathAI]] project. The code described
here is part 1 of the work.

* TODO RAS MAPK pathway (Check where Viola got these gene lists from).

In this work we are intrested in the interplay between the RAAS and
MAPK pathways because..

I obtained two lists of genes from the two pathways from a collegue.

In order to get a full list of genes that we are intreseted in and their
interactions, we augment our intital list and query pathway commons to
obtain a network of genes. We use the pyBravo tool to make this query.

The intial list is :


** Raas genes:
#+begin_src bash :dir "./scripts/" :results output :exports both :tangle ./scripts/get_genelist.sh :comments link :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
  cat ../data/initial_gene_list_files/raas_genes.txt
#+end_src

** Dopamine KEGG pathway:

#+begin_src bash bash :dir "./scripts/" :results output :exports both  :tangle ./scripts/get_genelist.sh :comments link :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
  cat ./data/initial_gene_list_files/DopamineKEGGpathway.txt
#+end_src


The intersection of these files is:
#+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
  grep -Fxf ./data/initial_gene_list_files/DopamineKEGGpathway.txt ./data/initial_gene_list_files/raas_genes.txt
#+end_src



The union of these files is:

#+begin_src bash :results output :export both
  cat ./data/initial_gene_list_files/DopamineKEGGpathway.txt ./data/initial_gene_list_files/raas_genes.txt | sort | uniq | tee ./data/initial_gene_list_files/initial_gene_list.txt
  wc -l ./data/initial_gene_list_files/initial_gene_list.txt
#+end_src



Next in order to understand which other genes have known interactions
with this list and how this list is related we query pathway commons
using pybravo.

For Pybravo to function, it must connect to a SPARQL endpoint from
Pathway Commons. Unfortunately, this resource can be unreliable at
times. However, it’s possible to set up a local SPARQL endpoint by
building a Docker container. A Docker recipe file is available in this
GitHub repository:

https://github.com/mkarikom/PathwayCommons-VOS#pathwaycommons-v12-on-virtuoso-7

With Pybravo installed and an appropriate Conda environment set up, we
can configure Pybravo to connect to our local instance of the Pathway
Commons SPARQL endpoint for querying.


We have set up the command to run from a Biomake file (makeprog in the
scripts directory).



#+begin_src bash :dir "./scripts/" :exports both :eval query :results output
  biomake "augment_gene_list" | tail -n 40
#+end_src


This results in the creation of four files in the pybravo_output dir

expanded_reg_md10-provenance.csv
expanded_reg_md10-unified-provenance.csv expanded_reg_md10-unified.sif
expanded_reg_md10.sif

The expanded_reg_md10-unified.sif file can be viewed in cyto scape.

* Next steps

In the next page we will import the single cell data alongside the
network describe some properties of the data and then make a data
table of the transcriptome in our samples and genes of intrest.
