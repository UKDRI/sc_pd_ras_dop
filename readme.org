#+TITLE: ParkinsonPathAI (Working title) - AI Models for Pathway Analysis in Parkinson’s Disease

#+Author: Sam Neaves

* Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data from
brain cells of both control and Parkinson’s disease donors. Our goal
is to characterize the complex interplay between the RAS and dopamine
pathways, we will attempt to do this using symbolic AI techniques. By employing methods like
descriptive rule induction, causal analysis, and model
building/repair, we aim to identify and understand unique cell states
associated with Parkinson’s disease.

Our approach reconciles gene networks with experimental data, allowing
us to reason about network consistency and potentially discover key
molecular signatures involved in disease progression. This repository will
contain code, data preprocessing steps, and model implementation
details for this exploratory analysis.

This is an open scientific project, actively developed in the
open-source community and a continuous work in progress. As the
results are preliminary, they may evolve over time with further
analysis and validation. If you spot any errors or have suggestions,
please feel free to open an issue. Contributions and feedback from the
community are welcome to help improve and refine our understanding of
the RAS and dopamine pathways in Parkinson’s disease.

* Data

Biological cell samples were collected postmortem from the ventral
substantia nigra of seven control samples, nine Parkinson's disease
samples, and four samples from patients with Incidental Lewy Body
Disorder. The nuclei of these cells were extracted and sequenced,
totaling 23,885 nuclei. The sequecning was deep and full
length. [INSERT DETALS OF SEQUENCING TECH OR REFERNCE]

** System biology approach

Our approach to this analysis is based on symbolic systems biology.
In systems biology we aim to understand and model the biological
reality at a system level, that is understanding how many aspects of
biology interact to cause our observations. This is in conrast to
looking at specific decompatialised observations. Symbolic system
biology differs from quantitive symbolic biology in the level of
abstraction.
The use of discrete symbols to represent aspects of the system rather
than specific quantitites has a number of advantages which we seek to
exploit.
Firstly, the abstraction of measured data to symbols is a way to
handle noise.
Secondly, the abstraction reduces the size of state space that we are examining.
This means that certain computational methods become tractable.
Thirdly, as our aim is to understand what is happening and ultimatly
control the system.  It is therefore important that our models and their dynamics
are intertplble, so that suggested interventions and there
consequences can be ratified in a laboratory setting.

Forthyly, there is evidence that symbolic abstraction is sufficent to model the dynamics in
many cases.

Biological reality is extremely complicated.

The basic idea of DNA -> (transcribed) RNA -> (translated) Protein,
which takes part in a series of biochemical reactions to build,
maintain and controll cells is
sound and present however the details around transcription,
translation and metabolic pathways ultimatly leading to disease are
complex and what we seek to understand.

In somatic cells the DNA is immutable as they replicate into daughter
cells.
The differnce between cells .
Cell differnation.
Gene regulatory networks.

Transcription can be bursty.
Alternative splicing
Protein complex formation. - chaperones.
Epigentics, methylation and histone access.


*** Intreptation of sequence data as instances in state space.

In our analysis of transcriptome from nuclei, previous work has
identified cell types using x method.
In addition cell states have been identified by y method.

** RAS MAPK pathway

In this work we are intrested in these pathways and the interplay.
In order to get a list of genes that we are intreseted in and there
interactions, we first manually curate a list of genes by augmenting a
list of querying for list of pathway genes.

The intial list is :

Next in order to understand which other genes have known interactions
with this list and how this list is related we query pathway commons
using pybravo.

In order for pybravo to work it needs to be able to connect to a
sparql endpoint of pathway commons. Unforntly this resource can be
unrelaibly, however it is possible to set up a local sparql end point
by building a docker container. A docker recipe file is provided from
this github repo:
https://github.com/mkarikom/PathwayCommons-VOS#pathwaycommons-v12-on-virtuoso-7

With pybravo installed and an appropiate conda enivorment set up and
then pybravo set to point at our local instance of pathway commons
sparql end point we can query the resource.

We have set up the command to run from a biomake file (makeprog - in
the scripts dir)


#+begin_src bash :dir "./scripts/" :exports both :eval query :results output
  biomake "augment_gene_list" | tail -n 40

** Subgroup discovery of celluar states

As a first step we want to follow the spirit of ww11 bomber command.
The story goes that aeroplanes returning to england were analysed and
where damage had occured this was observed. It was then infered that
planes could survive in such a state, so to improve surviablilty of
the aircraft armour would be improved by designing armour for
improvements where damage had not been observed to have occured. As
these were planes that were lost.

In our analagy it is known that in parkinson disease dn's are lost, so
observations from parkinson paitence of cell states are of neurons
that have survived.

Forntuelty we do have access to CTRL data. Of course these are not
from people who have parkinsons but we hope to be able to use this as
a proxy.

We wish to identify descriptions (in terms of conjunctions of gene
expression statements) that select group of cell states that are
statistically differnt in terms of there distrubtion statistics from
the combined population of cells.

In order to do this we turn to the task of "Subgroup discovery" first
described by Wrobel et al. Subgroup discovery is a data mining/kdd/ml
task that lies at the intersection of classification and
clustering. We use labelled data as in classification, but we wish to
describe groups of (statisically) intresting instances. We wish for
the descriptions to be interprtable and informative.

Subgroup discovery has been used in bioinformatics for analysing gene
expression before in x, y,z. in those studies it is similar to Gene set enrichment analysis. where
genes are the instances, there descriptions are annotations such as
GO-TERMs and there label are binary (differntly expressed or not).

In contrast to these previous studies,  our instances are
cells/nuclai and are target/class/label is CTRL or parkinson and are
features are gene expression values as we want to identify and
describe subgroups of cellular transcriptome states which appear in
ctrl samples but not parkinson patients.

In this first inital analysis and attempt to identify subgroups of
cellular states we limit the subgroup discovery to a propositional
data mining task. We do not use the relations provided by the query to
pathway commons. These could potentially be usefull. If we wanted to
explore that then we would need to use a method such as RSD,
potentially hedwig. Instead the query to Pathway commons using pybravo
can be seen as a feature selection technique.

** Data info

"Just sending the single nuclei data for the dopaminergic neurons in our atlas as Caleb suggested.
The file “SNatlas_DaNs_seurat.RData” is in the usual Dropbox folder.
The Seurat object in it is called “sn_atlas_dans” and contains all
neurons across all disease stages and subtypes. You can access disease
by sn_atlas_dans$Disease and cell subtype by
sn_atlas_dans$CellSubType. And extract gene expression data as raw
counts genes_counts<-as.matrix(GetAssayData(sn_atlas_dans, slot =
"counts")) or normalised
genes_norm<-as.matrix(GetAssayData(sn_atlas_dans, slot = "data"))."

In the graph representation we have genes and protein complexes.
A protein complex node is represented by Item/Item. For example

SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS

When we match our gene expression data to the network. These nodes
will be unobserved. We will need to infer if they are able to
form/activate.

In the way that the pybravo paper describes these nodes are used in
there iggy analysis. The part of edge is treated as plus. But I think the standard consistency
check is only looking for at least one positive edge. So not sure if
that is appropiate. (will detail later).

For the time being the number of complexes seem to be :

#+begin_src R :session :exports both
# Identify rows in the 'name' column that contain '/'
complexes <- grep("/", nodes)

# Count the number of complexes
num_complexes <- length(complexes)

# View the count
num_complexes
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 296

#+begin_src R :session :exports both
# Count occurrences of each edge type in the second column (V2)
edge_counts <- table(network_data$V2)

# Display the counts of each edge type
print(edge_counts)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| ACTIVATION | 1710 |
| INHIBITION |  655 |
| PART_OF    |  567 |
| UNKNOWN    |   95 |

* do we want to extract min graph of nodes in subgroup rule?
