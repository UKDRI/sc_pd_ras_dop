* Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data from
brain cells of both control and Parkinson’s disease donors. Our goal
is to characterize the complex interplay between the RAS and dopamine
pathways using symbolic AI techniques. By employing methods like
descriptive rule induction, causal analysis, and model
building/repair, we aim to identify and understand unique cell states
associated with Parkinson’s disease.


Our approach reconciles gene networks with experimental data, allowing
us to reason about network consistency and potentially discover key
molecular signatures involved in disease progression. This repository
contains code, data preprocessing steps, and model implementation
details for this exploratory analysis.
