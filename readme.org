#+TITLE: ParkinsonPathAI (Working title) - AI Models for Pathway Analysis in Parkinson’s Disease

#+Author: Sam Neaves

* Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data from
brain cells of both control and Parkinson’s disease donors. Our goal
is to characterize the complex interplay between the RAS and dopamine
pathways using symbolic AI techniques. By employing methods like
descriptive rule induction, causal analysis, and model
building/repair, we aim to identify and understand unique cell states
associated with Parkinson’s disease.


Our approach reconciles gene networks with experimental data, allowing
us to reason about network consistency and potentially discover key
molecular signatures involved in disease progression. This repository will
contain code, data preprocessing steps, and model implementation
details for this exploratory analysis.

This is an open scientific project, actively developed in the
open-source community and a continuous work in progress. As the
results are preliminary, they may evolve over time with further
analysis and validation. If you spot any errors or have suggestions,
please feel free to open an issue. Contributions and feedback from the
community are welcome to help improve and refine our understanding of
the RAS and dopamine pathways in Parkinson’s disease.
